# A Fine-Tuned Geospatial Foundation Model for Flood Detection

## About
Public notebooks and utilities for running inference and fine tuning

## Setup
1. clone the repository: 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ibm-granite/geospatial.git
```
2. Set up a virtual environment. Python 3.10 is recommended.
3. Activate the virtual environment. 
4. Install the relevant packages. This will depend on where you're running the notebooks.
  - on Google Colab `pip install -e ./geospatial/uki-flooddetection[colab]` 
  - on local machine 
      ```
      cd geospatial/uki-flooddetection
      
      pip install -e .[notebooks]
      ```
      please note: depending on the set-up on your machine, slightly different notations may be needed e.g. `pip install -e ."[notebooks]"`

## Notebooks 
We have two notebooks available. 

1. Check out the [1_getting_started](./notebooks/1_getting_started.ipynb) notebook to run a fine-tuned flood detection model. 
2. For a demonstration of fine tuning for flood detection in a different location, please see the [2_fine_tuning-tuning](./notebooks/2_fine_tuning.ipynb) notebook

## Data
Data to run the examples is archived [here](https://zenodo.org/records/14216851). Data download is handled automatically by the download script.

# Model Card for granite-geospatial-uki

The granite-geospatial-uki model is a transformer-based geospatial foundation model trained on HLS L30 multispectral satellite imagery and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) backscatter over the United Kingdom and Ireland. The model consists of a self-supervised encoder developed with a ViT architecture and Masked AutoEncoder (MAE) learning strategy, with an MSE loss function and follows the same architecture as [Prithvi-EO](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-nasa-geospatial/prithvi-for-earth-observation-6740a7a81883466bf41d93d6).

## How to Get Started with the Model 

An example of fine-tuning the model for image segmentation using Terratorch for flood detection in the UK and Ireland can be found [here](./notebooks/2_fine_tuning.ipynb).

## Pre-training 

The granite-geospatial-uki model uses the [Prithvi-EO](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-nasa-geospatial/prithvi-for-earth-observation-6740a7a81883466bf41d93d6) model architecture. It was pre-trained starting from initial model weights which were pre-trained from data that covered the continental USA and did not include SAR data, then an additional pre-training was applied using 16,000 HLS L30 and Sentinel-1 images which cover the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter ($\sigma_0$) were resampled to the same resolution as the HLS data, and were normalized by $10log(\sigma_0)$, where pixels with $10log(\sigma_0) > 10$  are set to 10 and $10log(\sigma_0) < -35$ are set to -35. The two additional Sentinel-1 bands were initialized with the mean weights of the other channels for pre-training. The following bands were used in the pre-trained model:

- Blue
- Green
- Red
- Narrow NIR
- SWIR 1
- SWIR 2 
- VV
- VH
